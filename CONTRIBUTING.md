# Contributing to Zonemaster::Engine

Contribution to this repository is welcome. Contribution can be either an issue
report or a code or a documentation update. Also see the information in the
[main README][Zonemaster/Zonemaster README] in the main Zonemaster respository.

## Issue

First search for a similar issue in the [issues list]. If a relevant issue is
found, add your information as a comment. If no relevant issue is found, create a
[new][create issue] issue. Give as many details as you have and describe, if
possible, how the issue can be reproduced.

## Pull request

If you have a solution for an issue, or a suggestion for an improvment, please
first search for a pull request for the same issue among open [pull requests].
If nothing relevant is found or you want to contribute with a different solution,
create a [new][create pull request] pull request, which assumes that you have
your proposal in a fork repository.

When you create a pull request, please always start with the `develop` branch
and create the pull request against the same branch.
