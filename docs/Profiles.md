# Profiles

## Default profile

The default profile is documented in the [profile properties] section
of the Zonemaster::Engine::Profile module.

At the time of writing there is no authoritative documentation for the
default value of the `test_levels` property.
For the time being, please refer to the file located by [dist_file(
"Zonemaster-Engine", "default.profile" )].

## Creating profiles

For a complete example of a profile JSON file, refer to the file located
